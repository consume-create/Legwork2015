The browser on your phone lets you aim and roll the ball with a flick of your wrist, while the browser on your computer renders the real time graphics of the Roll It alley with WebGL and Canvas. The two devices communicate via WebSockets. No apps. No downloads. No tokens. All you need is a modern browser.",
