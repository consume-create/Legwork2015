    "overview": "Hike Nike NYC was a month long pop-up experience that introduced Nike’s new Sneakerboot collection. In the store, shoppers could demo the product through an interactive photo booth that dropped them into a rainy scene in the LES designed by illustrator Steve Harrington. By using digital touch-points that tracked product choices throughout the experience, we were able to craft a custom video for each participant that was stitched up and delivered on the fly.",
