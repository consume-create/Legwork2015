    "overview": "It had been a while since we worked with CP+B, which is strange considering our offices are only a half-hour drive apart. Our first project together in years, \"The Tuck Effect,\" has seen tremendous success both online and in broadcast. Our work showcases the results of a scientific study by Fruit of the Loom that reveals men who tuck their shirts are happier, more successful and, generally, wealthier. We hoped to inspire non-tuckers with content related to the powers of tucking.",
